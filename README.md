# Dog-Breed-Prediction-Deep-Learning
This dataset of dog pictures is a given. The label (breed category) of an image serves as the name of a subfolder in the training dataset. For instance, the breed category 9 is home to all of the photos in subfolder 9. The categorization of the dog photos in the test dataset must be predicted.
